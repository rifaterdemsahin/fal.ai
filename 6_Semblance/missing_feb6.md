Looking at this documentation, here are the key things that appear to be **missing or underdeveloped**:

1. **Text & Typography Generation** - No mention of scripts for generating text overlays, subtitles, captions, or styled typography assets. Given the video and animation focus, text generation seems like a natural gap.

2. **3D Asset Generation** - No scripts for 3D models, 3D animations, or 3D rendering. Many modern projects need 3D elements.

3. **Color & Palette Management** - No utilities for generating or managing color palettes, color schemes, or theme consistency across assets.

4. **Batch Processing Orchestration** - While individual batch scripts exist, there's no mention of a master orchestrator that runs multiple batch processes sequentially or in parallel, or manages dependencies between asset types.

5. **Quality Assurance & Validation** - No QA scripts mentioned for validating generated assets (checking dimensions, file integrity, color space compliance, etc.).

6. **Asset Optimization Pipeline** - While output format optimization is mentioned, there's no mention of general optimization (compression, resizing, format conversion utilities).

7. **Metadata & SEO Tagging** - No system for automatically generating or embedding metadata, tags, descriptions, or SEO information into assets.

8. **Template System** - No mention of asset templates or template inheritance for consistent styling across batches.

9. **Error Recovery & Retry Logic** - Limited documentation on what happens when API calls fail and how the system recovers.

10. **Asset Dependency Tracking** - No system for tracking which assets depend on others (e.g., "this video uses these images and audio files").

11. **Localization/Multi-language Support** - No scripts for generating assets in multiple languages or regional variants.

12. **Performance Monitoring & Logging** - Beyond cost estimation, no centralized logging or performance analytics mentioned.

Would you like me to help you create documentation or scaffolding for any of these missing components?
