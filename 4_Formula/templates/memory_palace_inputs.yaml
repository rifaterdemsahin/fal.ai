# Memory Palace Design Principles:
#
# 1. Sequential Flow:
#    - Create a logical path through locations
#    - Each location builds on the previous
#    - Start with entrance, end with conclusion/vista
#
# 2. Visual Distinctiveness:
#    - Each location should be immediately recognizable
#    - Use unique architectural elements
#    - Employ different color schemes per location
#
# 3. Concept Mapping:
#    - Match location characteristics to concepts
#    - Use metaphors (e.g., library = knowledge, garden = growth)
#    - Make connections intuitive
#
# 4. Emotional Anchoring:
#    - Add emotional elements (peace, excitement, wonder)
#    - Use lighting to set mood
#    - Create memorable moments
#
# 5. Architectural Consistency:
#    - Maintain the same seed_key across locations
#    - Keep a unified architectural style
#    - Ensure visual coherence
#
# Common Memory Palace Locations:
# - entrance: Introduction, gateway
# - hallway: Timeline, progression
# - main_chamber: Core concepts, central ideas
# - library: Knowledge, research, depth
# - garden: Growth, applications, natural flow
# - laboratory: Experimentation, practice
# - observatory: Future vision, big picture
# - vault: Secrets, advanced topics
# - courtyard: Community, collaboration
# - exit: Conclusion, call to action
#
# Seed Key Recommendations:
# - SEED_MEMORY: 888001 (for architectural consistency)
# - Use same seed across all memory palace locations
# - This ensures visual coherence of the palace
