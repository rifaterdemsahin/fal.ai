# Image Generation Guidelines:
#
# Model Selection:
# - fal-ai/flux/schnell: Fast (4 steps), good for iterations and drafts
# - fal-ai/flux/dev: High quality (28-50 steps), use for final outputs
#
# Image Sizes (16:9 ratio):
# - HD: 1280 x 720
# - Full HD: 1920 x 1080
# - 4K: 3840 x 2160
#
# Image Sizes (other ratios):
# - Square: 1024 x 1024
# - Portrait: 1080 x 1920
# - Wide: 2560 x 1440
#
# Inference Steps:
# - flux/schnell: 4 (fixed, fast)
# - flux/dev: 28 (balanced), 40 (high quality), 50 (maximum quality)
#
# Prompt Tips:
# - Be specific about style (photorealistic, illustration, vector art)
# - Include quality markers (8k, highly detailed, professional)
# - Describe composition (centered, rule of thirds, symmetrical)
# - Add mood/atmosphere descriptors
# - Mention color palette if important
#
# Priority Levels:
# - HIGH: Essential images, cannot be omitted
# - MEDIUM: Enhances the video, nice to have
# - LOW: Optional, can skip if budget/time limited
