# Audio Generation Guidelines:
#
# Audio vs Music:
# - audio: Sound effects, transitions, notifications
# - music: Background tracks, intro/outro themes
#
# Duration Standards:
# - Sound effects: 1-5 seconds
# - Transitions: 2-3 seconds
# - Intro music: 10-15 seconds
# - Background music: 30-60 seconds
# - Outro music: 15-20 seconds
#
# Prompt Tips for Sound Effects:
# - Describe the sound type (whoosh, ping, click)
# - Mention texture (clean, gritty, smooth)
# - Specify use case (transition, notification, UI)
# - Add quality descriptors (professional, cinematic)
#
# Prompt Tips for Music:
# - Start with genre/style (electronic, ambient, orchestral)
# - Mention mood/energy (upbeat, calm, intense)
# - Specify tempo if important (120 BPM, slow)
# - Note "no vocals" if instrumental only
# - Describe instruments if specific
# - Add use case (background, intro, outro)
#
# Priority Levels:
# - HIGH: Essential audio, required for video flow
# - MEDIUM: Enhances experience, nice to have
# - LOW: Optional polish, can skip if needed
