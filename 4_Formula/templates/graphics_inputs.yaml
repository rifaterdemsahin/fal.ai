# Graphics Guidelines:
#
# Common Graphic Types:
# - Lower thirds: Name/title overlays for speakers
# - Overlays: Patterns, textures for background enhancement
# - Call-to-action: Subscribe, like, comment prompts
# - Transitions: Visual elements for scene changes
# - Banners: Social media handles, website info
# - Icons: Custom icons for specific topics
# - Badges: Achievement, milestone graphics
#
# Design Considerations:
# - Keep text areas clear for later text insertion
# - Use transparent backgrounds when possible
# - Consider video-safe color contrasts
# - Design for 1920x1080 (Full HD) by default
# - Leave space for text overlay if applicable
#
# Color Schemes:
# - Tech/Modern: Blues, cyans, purples
# - Professional: Navy, gray, white
# - Energetic: Red, orange, yellow
# - Calm: Green, teal, blue
# - Luxury: Gold, black, white
#
# Prompt Tips:
# - Specify "transparent background" if needed
# - Mention "broadcast quality" or "professional"
# - Describe placement (lower third, corner, center)
# - Include text layout needs
# - Add style keywords (minimalist, bold, elegant)
#
# Size Recommendations:
# - Full frame graphics: 1920 x 1080
# - Lower thirds: 1920 x 300 (but generate at full size)
# - Icons/badges: 1024 x 1024 (square)
# - Banners: 1920 x 400
