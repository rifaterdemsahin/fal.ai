### 7_Testing - Validation

**Validation Strategy**:

1. **Automated Unit Tests**:
    * **`test_asset_utils.py`**: 13 unit tests for asset utilities
        * Tests for filename generation and standardization
        * Scene number extraction
        * Description cleaning and sanitization
        * Manifest tracking functionality
    * **Test Status**: ✅ 13/13 tests passing
    * **Run Command**: `python 5_Symbols/test_asset_utils.py`

2. **Integration Tests**:
    * **`test_integration.py`**: End-to-end workflow validation
        * Tests complete asset generation pipeline
        * Validates filename format compliance
        * Verifies manifest structure and content
        * Ensures cross-generator consistency
    * **Test Status**: ✅ All integration tests passing
    * **Run Command**: `python 5_Symbols/test_integration.py`

3. **Runtime Checks**:
    * Scripts report `✅ Successful` or `❌ Failed` counts at the end of execution.
    * A `generation_summary.json` is created in the output directory detailing every attempt.
    * Manifest tracking provides complete asset audit trail.

4. **Manual Verification** (The "Reasonable Unknown"):
    * **Visual Check**: Open generated MP4/PNG files. Verify they match the prompt's intent (e.g., "Empty UK Streets" should look like UK streets).
    * **Technical Check**: Ensure files are not 0 bytes. Check resolution (e.g., 1080p, 4k) and aspect ratio (16:9).
    * **Audio Check**: Listen for glitches or hallucinations in generated audio.
    * **Naming Check**: Verify standardized naming convention is followed (`{scene:03d}_{type}_{desc}_v{version}.{ext}`).

5. **Integration Test with Video Editor**:
    * Import a sample generated asset into the target video editor (DaVinci Resolve/Premiere) to ensure codec compatibility.
    * Verify scene-based organization works correctly.
    * Test manifest.json for prompt reference during editing.

**Test Coverage Summary**:
* ✅ Unit Tests: 13/13 passing
* ✅ Integration Tests: All passing
* ✅ Filename Convention: Validated
* ✅ Manifest Tracking: Validated
* ✅ Base Class Architecture: Validated
* 📊 Code Quality: Documented in `6_Semblance/`

### 6. Batch Generation Validation (Quality Check)

* **Purpose**: Run a small batch of actual image generations to verify API connectivity, model output quality, and file saving.
* **Output Location**: All artifacts (PNGs, JSONs) are saved to `7_TestingKnown/TestOutput/`.
* **Run Command**: `python 7_TestingKnown/Tests/test_batch_generation.py`
* **Configuration**: The test uses a hardcoded batch of 2 images with `fal-ai/flux/schnell` for speed/cost.
