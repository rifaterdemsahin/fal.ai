**Objective**: Automate the creation of high-quality multimedia assets (video, audio, graphics) for "The Agentic Era" project using generative AI models via the fal.ai API.

**Key Results**:
- **KR1**: Establish a robust suite of Python scripts for batch asset generation (Video, Audio, Images, Icons).
- **KR2**: Successfully integrate `fal-client` to programmatically generate content from text prompts.
- **KR3**: Produce production-ready B-roll (1080p/4k), background music, and visual elements (lower thirds, chapter markers) for the final video edit.
- **KR4**: Minimize manual workflow time by automating the prompt-to-asset pipeline.
